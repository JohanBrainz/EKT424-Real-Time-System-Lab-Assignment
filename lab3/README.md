# Lab Assignment 3 - Precise period of task		


#### **Learning Outcome:**

1.	Usage of accurate timer on POSIX compliant OS
2.	Scheduling your process with Real Time Scheduler on Linux ###
		
### In this assignment, 

1.	Change your laboratory assignment 2 code to get precise timing of the task period by means of **timer_create()** and **timer_settime()** function. You may reduce your task to 3 task only and varies your task execution time accordingly.

2. To achieve real time timing requirement, look at the following page [HERE](http://pficheux.free.fr/eyrolles/linux_embarque/docs_externes/POSIX4.html) as well the man pages, plus examples on google.

**The website link I had provided provides very good information about clock and timers on Linux, so you need to read those prior to designing your solution.**
