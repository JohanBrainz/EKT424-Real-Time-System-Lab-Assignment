# Lab Assignment 2 - Get your actual process ready


In this assignment you are required to design a solution to system which composes of 5 tasks namely task T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5. T1 down to to T5 should execute for 500 miliseconds each. Once the process is created by means of fork( ), you are required to overlay the process with a different code ( meant to be your actual Tasks code using any of the execl( ) system call.  

1.	Each Task period must be set to 5seconds. 

**Record your observation.**

**Hint:** *To measure the execution of your task please use **clock_gettime()** function instead of gettimeofday( ).*
